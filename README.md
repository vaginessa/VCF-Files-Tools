# VCF-Files-Tools
Best App for Read and Write VCF Files (contact used in android and other devices) very fast and powerfull
### this project forked from https://contacts.codeplex.com/
VCF Tools is a managed API for working with the new .Contact format introduced with Microsoft Windows Vista. This lets developers incorporate Windows Contacts into their applications using any .Net language, such as C#, VB.Net, C++/CLI, F#, etc., using a higher level and more strongly typed object model than what's exposed by the COM IContact APIs published with the Windows Vista SDK. Long term it is also intended to be a set of reusable widgets for displaying contact data in the context of larger programs, similar to what the WAB APIs offer.

### Some features contained in VCF Tools that are more than what is available in the native IContact APIs include
> Import and export from vCard format<br>
Better group support, including the ability to work with two different types of groups: one is the .group format supported by WAB in Vista, the other is a format using the underlying XML schema that is consumable by clients directly accessing the XML.<br>
The ability to work with contact collections not rooted in the user's Contacts folder.<br>
User tile framing consistent with the Vista UI.<br>
Per-property attribute information.<br>
UI. For a preview, check out the Screenshots page.<br>
Works on XP.
